almost like "worse" versions of arrays and linked-lists
stacks-like a stack of plates
---can only take a plate off the top
---you'll never take a place from the middle or bottom
---if you want to add you can only add to the top

implement with
-linked list with a tail pointer
-arrays


used when creating programming languages


push add an item to top of stack
pop remove item from the top of the stackk
peek - see the top of the stack
both O(1)

empty



=======================================================
stacks - always working from the top of the stack
queues - working on both ends
****line for food - first in first out
***earlier you join the queue, earlier you get out of the queue
***added to the back, removed from the front


Ring Buffer - ensures we get O(1) access on both endsd
--Array with a head and tail pointer, which wraps at the ends
adding - tail pointer moves further right
deleting - head pointer moves further right

tail pointer can wrap around edges of array 
to get back to the start


enqueue: add an item to the end of the queue
dequeue: remove an item from the start of the queue
O(1)
